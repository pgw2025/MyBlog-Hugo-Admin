Set the property enable = true under [params.math] in your site configuration and the property math: true of the article front matter to enable the automatic rendering of mathematical formulas. $\\KaTeX$ automatically renders formulas based on specific delimiters. Tip\rHere is a list of $\\TeX$ functions supported by $\\KaTeX$.\rNote\rSince Hugo generates HTML documents according to the syntax such as _/*/\u003e\u003e when rendering Markdown documents, and some text content in the form of escape characters (such as \\(/\\)/\\[/\\]/\\\\) escape processing will be performed automatically, therefore, additional escape character expressions are required for these places to achieve automatic rendering: _ -\u003e \\_ * -\u003e \\* \u003e\u003e -\u003e \\\u003e\u003e \\( -\u003e \\\\( \\) -\u003e \\\\) \\[ -\u003e \\\\[ \\] -\u003e \\\\] \\\\ -\u003e \\\\\\\\ LoveIt theme supports raw shortcode to avoid these escape characters, which helps you write raw mathematical formula content. Example raw input: Inline Formula: {{\u003c raw \u003e}}\\(\\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}_{i}=\\mathbf{E}_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots\\){{\u003c /raw \u003e}} Block Formula: {{\u003c raw \u003e}} \\[ a=b+c \\\\ d+e=f \\] {{\u003c /raw \u003e}}\rThe rendered output looks like this: Inline Formula: Block Formula: Inline Formula The default inline delimiters are: $ ... $ \\( ... \\) (escaped: \\\\( ... \\\\)) For example: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\\\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\\\)\rThe rendered output looks like this: $c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ and \\(f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi\\) Block Formula The default block delimiters are: $$ ... $$ \\[ ... \\] (escaped: \\\\[ ... \\\\]) \\begin{equation} ... \\end{equation} (unnumbered: \\begin{equation*} ... \\end{equation*}) \\begin{align} ... \\end{align} (unnumbered: \\begin{align*} ... \\end{align*}) \\begin{alignat} ... \\end{alignat} (unnumbered: \\begin{alignat*} ... \\end{alignat*}) \\begin{gather} ... \\end{gather} (unnumbered: \\begin{gather*} ... \\end{gather*}) \\begin{CD} ... \\end{CD} For example: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\\\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\\\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}\\_{i}=\\mathbf{E}\\_{1}+\\mathbf{E}\\_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\\\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\\\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\\\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\\\u003e\u003e B \\\\\\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\\\\\ C @= D \\end{CD}\rThe rendered output looks like this: $$ c = \\pm\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} $$ \\[ f(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\hat{f}(\\xi) e^{2 \\pi i \\xi x} d \\xi \\] \\begin{equation*} \\rho \\frac{\\mathrm{D} \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathrm{D} t}=\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbb{P}+\\rho \\mathbf{f} \\end{equation*} \\begin{equation} \\mathbf{E}=\\sum_{i} \\mathbf{E}_{i}=\\mathbf{E}_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{2}+\\mathbf{E}_{3}+\\cdots \\end{equation} \\begin{align} a\u0026=b+c \\\\ d+e\u0026=f \\end{align} \\begin{alignat}{2} 10\u0026x+\u00263\u0026y = 2 \\\\ 3\u0026x+\u002613\u0026y = 4 \\end{alignat} \\begin{gather} a=b \\\\ e=b+c \\end{gather} \\begin{CD} A @\u003ea\u003e\u003e B \\\\ @VbVV @AAcA \\\\ C @= D \\end{CD} Tip\rYou can add more inline and block delimiters in your site configuration.\rCopy-tex Copy-tex is an extension for $\\KaTeX$.

Note\rThis article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page. If you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page. Let’s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages. Markdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it. Some of the key benefits are: Markdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email. – John Gruber Without further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!

When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page. To create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially. Add the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables. This is a digital footnote[^1].
